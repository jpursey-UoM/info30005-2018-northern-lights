<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>
    The goal of the project is to build a medium-scale web
    application (i.e. one that one person alone could not build)
    that solves a practical problem based on a given brief.
    In 2018, we want to tackle big societal challenges. The goal
    is to build a web-based application that contributes towards
    a solution to one of the challenges proposed by OpenIDEO.
    OpenIDEO is an online platform for crowdsourcing solutions
    to worldâ€™s biggest problems. They frequently post challenges
    sponsored by external organisations, to which anyone can
    contribute solutions. The challenges are listed
    <a href="https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge">here</a>.

<h2>Marks Breakdown</h2>
<p>
    The handbook states that the project is worth 50% of the final
    mark. In previous editions of the course, students suggested
    that the project should be worth a higher percentage, given
    its large scope. I agree with this proposal, so, this
    semester, I will make the project is worth 60% of your
    final mark. If you wish to be marked according to the
    handbook, you should let me know before the start of Week
    3, otherwise your mark will be automatically calculated with
    a 60/40 split.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure continuous progress and to maximise the feedback
    that you receive throughout the semester, the project will
    be broken down into multiple deliverables. Apart from Weeks
    1 and 8, all weeks will have a deliverable due, some for
    formative assessment and some for summative assessment.
    This means that even though all will be graded, the mark you
    will receive for the deliverable will only count towards your
    final mark in the summative assessment. The formative assessment
    of deliverables is designed to give you feedback on your
    progress and a sense of whether you are on the right track.
    The deliverables will have the following weights:
