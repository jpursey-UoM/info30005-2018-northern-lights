<h1>Food Waste</h1>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p><q>How might we dramatically reduce waste by transforming our
    relationship with food?</q></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>

    Each year 250,000 tonnes of food is thrown out in Victoria alone, making up
    25% of household rubbish. This means the resources that went into growing,
    processing, transporting and storing this food is wasted. While various
    charity organisations work to reduce food wastage from businesses, there is
    very little being done to help individuals cook more efficiently.

    Increasing work hours and busy lives often result in food rotting in a
    kitchen before it gets a chance to be eaten. This is made worse by the cheaper
    unit costs of buying food in bulk, which results in individuals buying more
    than they are likely to use.

    Governments in the UK, NSW and VIC have implemented the “Love Food, Hate Waste”
    campaign, which aims to inform people of the problem of food wastage, storage
    tips, and provide recipe ideas for leftover produce. While helpful to some,
    this approach does little to help those who already lead busy lives, and do
    not have time to cook additional recipes each week.

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The web app is going to be a platform to help establish relationship between
    individuals (eaters) and cooks who are willing to share the meals they cook
    by setting up a “home restaurant”.

    People who are too busy to cook can post a request online, describing what
    kind of food they are looking for and the budget they have. Those who have
    time and extra food can then cook based on need and sell their food at a lower
    price than those in restaurants.

    There will be a rating system for every cook in which all the eaters can
    rate and comment about the quality of the foods prepared by the cook. This
    would help other eaters while choosing a home restaurant.
