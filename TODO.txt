I found that the recently added ingredient such as Mozzarella, Turmeric, Chicken have undefined as their current expiry date.
Shall we change them in mlab? -- Wendy

shelfLife wasn't being set properly, I've fixed that and
update the existing ingredients. They look fine in mlab.
But now ownedIngredients don't get created properly, no
idea why.. --Jason
